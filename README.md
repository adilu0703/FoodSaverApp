Food Saver is an Android-based mobile application developed in Java, with Firebase as the database and XML for the front-end design. The app helps people find discounted or free food to reduce food wastage in Pakistan and utilize surplus food to assist those in need. Food providers can upload pictures and descriptions of surplus food, while consumers can request free or discounted food or even arrange for large quantities of food to be prepared for donation purposes. Food providers can accept requests directly. Food Saver also features a user-friendly interface with search filters, automatic notifications, a chatting portal, and location-sharing functionality integrated using the Google Maps API.
